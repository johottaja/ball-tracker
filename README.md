# balltracker

A small Python app for recording webcam video and inspecting it frame by frame, with a computer-vision pipeline aimed at finding a moving ball in the scene.

The main UI lives in `video_viewer/`: record from a camera, play back clips, step through frames, and apply filters to the live preview or playback.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or another way to install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- A webcam (for recording); macOS may prompt for camera permission on first use

## Setup

```bash
cd balltracker
uv sync
```

## Run

**Video viewer** (record, playback, filters):

```bash
uv run python -m video_viewer
```

Or:

```bash
uv run python video_viewer/viewer.py
```

**Training clip recorder** (named training sets, short clips):

```bash
uv run python -m training_recorder
```

## Using the training recorder

- Enter a **Training set** name (e.g. `throws_v1`). Clips for the same name are saved together.
- Choose a camera and use **Refresh** if needed.
- **Start clip** / **Stop clip** saves each take as `recordings/<training_set>/clip_<timestamp>.mp4` at the repo root.
- This folder is separate from `video_viewer/recordings/`, which the viewer uses for its single default recording.

## Using the viewer

**Record mode**

- Choose a camera from the dropdown and use **Refresh** if you plug one in later.
- **Start recording** / **Stop recording** saves to `video_viewer/recordings/recording.mp4` (raw video, no filters burned in).

**Playback mode**

- Switch to **Playback** after recording, or use **Open video…** to load a file.
- Controls: go to start, step one frame back/forward, play, pause.

**Filters**

- Pick a filter from the **Filter** dropdown (or the **Filters** menu on macOS when the app is focused).
- Filters affect the display only, not the saved recording.
- Several **Diff …** filters expose intermediate steps of the same pipeline (subtract, brightness, threshold, contours) for debugging. The end-to-end ball finder is **Ball detection**.

## Ball detection filter

**Ball detection** is the production-style filter: it runs the full motion pipeline on each frame (using the **previous frame** as reference), finds the best ball-shaped blob, and draws a thick red rectangle on the **original** camera image.

### Pipeline steps

1. **Frame difference** — `cv2.subtract(current, previous)` highlights what changed between consecutive frames. Static background tends to cancel out; a moving ball leaves a bright region.

2. **Brightness amplification** — the diff is scaled with `cv2.convertScaleAbs` (`DIFF_BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR`, default `5.0`) so faint motion is easier to threshold.

3. **Threshold** — the amplified image is converted to grayscale and binarized with `cv2.threshold` (`DIFF_THRESH_VALUE`, default `50`). Pixels above the cutoff become white (255).

4. **Morphological cleaning** — `cv2.morphologyEx(..., MORPH_OPEN)` with a 5×5 kernel removes small noise specks from the binary mask.

5. **Contour detection** — external contours are found on the cleaned mask (`cv2.findContours` with `RETR_EXTERNAL`).

6. **Circularity filter** — for each contour, circularity is  
   `(4π × area) / perimeter²`.  
   Contours in `(BALL_CIRCULARITY_MIN, BALL_CIRCULARITY_MAX]` (defaults `0.5`–`1.0`) are kept. A circle scores ~1.0; elongated or jagged shapes (e.g. arms) score lower and are rejected.

7. **Largest ball** — among circular contours, the one with the largest area is treated as the ball.

8. **Overlay** — a red bounding box (`cv2.boundingRect`) is drawn on the unmodified input frame (`DETECTION_RECT_THICKNESS`, default `6`).

### Tuning

Edit `video_viewer/config.py`:

| Parameter | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `DIFF_BRIGHTNESS_FACTOR` | How much to boost the frame diff before threshold |
| `DIFF_THRESH_VALUE` | Binary cutoff on amplified motion |
| `MORPH_KERNEL_SIZE` | Open kernel size for noise removal |
| `BALL_CIRCULARITY_MIN` / `BALL_CIRCULARITY_MAX` | Acceptable circularity range for a ball |
| `DETECTION_RECT_THICKNESS` | Box thickness on the output frame |
| `TARGET_RECORD_FPS` | Requested capture FPS (minimum enforced in software) |

Detection works best when the ball moves clearly between frames and the background is relatively stable. The first frame after a seek or camera switch has no valid previous frame, so nothing is detected until the next frame.
